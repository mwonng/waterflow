# Problem

There is a stack of water glasses in a form of triangle as illustrated. Each glass has a 250ml capacity.

When a liquid is poured into the top most glass any overflow is evenly distributed between the glasses in the next row. That is, half of the overflow pours into the left glass while the remainder of the overflow pours into the right glass.

Write a program that is able to calculate and illustrate how much liquid is in the j’th glass of the i’th row when K litres are poured into the top most glass.

The solution can be a command line tool or have a graphical interface. That is completely up to the candidate.

If any of the requirements are unclear, please make an appropriate assumption and document any assumptions made.
